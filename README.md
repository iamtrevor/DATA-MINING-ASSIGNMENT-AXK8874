Please follow the steps to compile or run the code.
1. Download the ipnyb file and open it on jupyter notebook.
2. We need to use tensorflow and also make sure that we already have numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn, catboost, xgboost, lightgbm, keras installed.
3. Now then just compile the notebook code for the output.
4. Else visit this link if you want the process to be much more easy so that this makes the implementaion of the code easy https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Dq3HAr1aVN_nUepL7tODWIs13Pcfv5cm?usp=sharing
